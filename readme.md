## Self Posts React Native App
This is my third React Native project where I develope a simple Self Posts app with these various features but not limited to:
* hooks only, redux, 
* SQLite (server)
* Image Picker
* Expo icons
* React Navigation (both top and bottom)
* forms, list (FlatList)
* error handlers (Alert)
* scroll
* modal window
